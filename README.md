Notes and Scripts

This is more for me to have my resources in multiple locations in case something  
were to happen to my notebooks and scripts. My handwriting isn't near the level of  
someone like Mara Avarick but it should be mostly legible (if you're old enough  
to read cursive!).

Scripts are from free online education sources with my comments so hopefully there  
aren't any copyright issues.  

Notebook currently contains notes from the Hopkins' courses and Hyndman book.  
Hope to add (mostly Lynda courses) Tableau, various SQLs, Excel Data Mining Add-in, HTML Widgets,  
flexdashboard, additional Shiny, and the MIT python course when I get the motivation.  
File is getting huge so I also need to do some splitting.
